# 🎵 Music Quiz App

An interactive **theory quiz and ear-training tool**.  
It challenges users to identify musical notes, intervals, and fretboard positions — with live scoring, timers, and a persistent leaderboard saved in local storage.

This project demonstrates **clean front-end logic**, **DOM manipulation**, and **data persistence** using the browser’s storage API — all without external frameworks.
